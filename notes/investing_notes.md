#  Process of Buying Securities
Define Goals
This is not actually the first step. After you’ve been investing for a while and have an idea of how to make money investing, then you can start to set goals, because then you will have numbers you can use to determine what are realistic goals, test if you can reach goals, and what it will take to get there. Trying to start here is hard because you don’t really know what is and is not possible when you start investing.


For instance if you are doing value based investing and you are finding that you can make 15% per year and you figured out you need $2,000,000 to retire then it becomes very easy to calculate how much more money you need or based on your monthly contributions how long until you reach your retirement goal.
VTI - Broad market
VOO - S&P 500 (vs. SPY?)
* Buy one and sell the other is not considered a wash sale?


Value based investing means that your investments are growing in their equity or value and the price of this asset (stock of a company) will continue to increase at some percentage compounding. This is generally done if you want to grow your overall net worth. A different form of investing is investing called cash flow and in stocks it is generally done via dividend investing. This is where a stock will perhaps not grow its overall value as much as it could and will instead pay the investors a cash value for each share that is owned. If a stock like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) was used to retire and the goal was $10k  per month, then looking at the ~$4 per year that each stock pays at a cost $172 per share (or $120000 per year / 2.46% dividend yield) = $4,878,048. There are other ways to do this like:
O (REET) 3.9% = $3,076,923
JEPI 7.38% = $1,626,016
NUSI 7.41% = ~$1.6m
QYLD (Covered call ETF) 9.79% = $1,225,740
SPHD
SCHD
VIG
VYM
NOBL


WARNING: Remember taxes have to come out of these numbers and they are capital gains for dividends and for options premiums.


Another example is perhaps you decide you could live off $10,000 a month and have your nest egg keep growing faster than inflation. If you’ve found that you can make $1,000 a month in passive income by selling options premiums when investing $30,000, then you know your goal is $300,000 of investing cash.


My Goals
My goal is to make $120k a year as a backup if I lose my job or as a possible retirement avenue. If I can do this, then I will be saving this money and investing it as well. As the previous paragraph says, I believe I can make $1k for every $30k invested per month. This will require $300k to start. If I can do this for 3 years and save the profits I will have over $600k to invest and this will provide over $240k per year to live off - this would be retirement.


NOTE: Currently I’ve been making about $2k in 3 months on $30k, so this is quite far off of the intent here. $8k per year on $30k is a return of 26% CAGR, which seems a little too good to be true. However, in the worst of cases I will be forced to buy the stock or sell it and this will be at prices I’ve already established I’m comfortable with.
Define Criteria
Identify criteria
* High growth: then we want small cap < $2b
* Steady growth: then we want large cap > $10b
* Less than 50% debt to asset ratio: we don’t want to lose it all
   * Debt is risky, if they cannot service their debt they have to file bankruptcy
* Value or Growth?
   * Historically this is P/E < 15 is value and P/E > 15 is growth
* Income or Growth?
   * Dividend safety score:
      * https://www.dividendmantra.com/2021/05/dividend-safety-score/#:~:text=Dividend%20safety%20scores%20can%20range,average%20risk%20of%20facing%20cuts. 
My Criteria
* P/E <= $15
   * Morningstar let’s you view historic P/E so you can choose if they are above or below average
* P/B ratio <= 3.0
   * This means that the company is trading at 3.0 times their current shareholder equity
   * If the company closed shop and went out of business today and the P/B was 3.0 then you would get 1/3.0 of the price you paid back
* Options
   * Low spread ?value?
      * so that if we have to get out we don’t lose a lot just on the spread
Identifying Prospects
Find companies you like, listen for them and if you understand the business and like what they are doing then add them to the watching list.


Can also look for companies that fit the financial profile we like to invest in:
* Debt to asset ratio of 50% or less
* Identify type to balance portfolio
* Filter website:
   * https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&f=cap_small,fa_debteq_u0.5,fa_fpe_low,geo_usa 


This stage involves following the new - to see what new companies are coming, what is changing in companies, and what regulations are in play that may affect companies
Investigating Prospects
Then we do due diligence/deep dive (DD) analysis, understand if the fundamentals are good and calculate the intrinsic value of the company.
* What do we expect the returns to be?
* What is the debt to sales ratio?


Buffet likes to consider management, we can use glassdoor to see what the employees say:
* https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Salesforce-Reviews-E11159.htm 
Calculating a Buy Price or Entry Point
Consider
* What does the stock normally trade at in P/E (over last 10 years preferably)
   * If this number is low, then why? 
      * Is it business problems or something like COVID?
   * If this number is high, then why?
      * Is it business problems or something like COVID?
   * Looking at AXP 
   * Just use the P/E ratio to figure out what a good buying price is
      * We have the earnings, and thus we just need to figure out what the $15 p/e ratio (or perhaps average) would happen at and be watching for the current price of the stock to get there
      * NOTE: if the average P/E for a stock is $50, then maybe wait for the stock to hit or go below it
* Historic P/E research:
   * https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/adbe/valuation
Watching Prospects


If the fundamentals are good then we should look to buy and if we’ve decided to do so, then now we need to determine a good price to buy at. 


Add the calculated numbers to alerts algo and monitor it.


A spreadsheet that does this for Meet Kevin:
* https://www.icloud.com/numbers/0Y9236Ylw258n--0Ycpyufw8g#Comparison_of_Companies 


Purchasing
Once the alert triggers, it’s time to buy the stock.


Now use technical analysis to decide when to buy. If there is a large trading volume pulling the stock down, then monitor it and let it continue to trend down. Watch for an inflection point and then execute.


Also monitor the sector. If it is heading down, then think about if you would like to wait to see what happens before jumping in.


Watch if volume is going up and price is going up, then we have momentum up, but if we have price going down and volume going up, then we should wait to purchase. If there is consolidation and volume is still high, then it means the buyers and sellers are competing the stock will probably move 


Monitoring Investments
Our goal is to never sell the stock, but if the reasons we bought the stock change, the fundamentals of the company change, or the government adds some regulations that will hinder the company's performance, then we need to know about it.


This stage involves following the news - to watch for changes to business you own.


Financials and Fundamental Analysis (investigating)
Balance Sheet
Total Assets
* An asset is a resource with economic value that an individual, corporation, or country owns or controls with the expectation that it will provide a future benefit.
* Assets are reported on a company's balance sheet and are bought or created to increase a firm's value or benefit the firm's operations.
* An asset can be thought of as something that, in the future, can generate cash flow, reduce expenses or improve sales, regardless of whether it's manufacturing equipment or a patent.
Total Liabilities
* Total liabilities are the combined debts that an individual or company owes. 
* They are generally broken down into three categories: short-term, long-term, and other liabilities.
* On the balance sheet, total liabilities plus equity must equal total assets.
Total Debt
* Debt is money borrowed by one party from another.
* Many corporations and individuals use debt as a method of making large purchases that they could not afford under normal circumstances.
* In a debt-based financial arrangement, the borrowing party gets permission to borrow money under the condition that it must be paid back at a later date, usually with interest.
* Debt can be classified into four main categories: secured, unsecured, revolving, or mortgaged.
* Corporations issue debt in the form of bonds to raise capital.
* Short Term Debt
   * Debt that is loaned for less than a year
* Long Term Debt
   * Debt that is loaned for more than a year
* Debt that is Current
   * Debt that will be paid off in the next year
Debt vs Liabilities
* Liability and debt and closely related concepts and may even be used interchangeably. But as discussed above, there are some critical differences between the two. Liabilities are a broader term, and debt is a type of liability. Liabilities arising out of the daily operations of the company, which results in an expense or obligation to be fulfilled in the future. Whereas debt only arises when a company borrows money from another party.
Total Shareholder Equity (SE) / Book Value
* Shareholder equity (SE) is the owner's claim after subtracting total liabilities from total assets.
* If shareholder equity is positive that means the company has enough assets to cover its liabilities, but if it is negative, then the company's liabilities exceed its assets.
* Retained earnings is part of shareholder equity and is the percentage of net earnings that were not paid to shareholders as dividends and should not be confused with cash or other liquid assets.
Revenue
* The amount of money made from selling the products or services that the business produces
Earnings / Net Income
* The bottom line
* How much money a company gets to keep after spying all operating expenses etc.
Cash Flow
* The total amount of inflows or outflows of cash
* This is different than Revent and Earnings as those focus on the products a business sells
* Cash Flow is total for all of the things the business does
* This includes investing, and other sources of income or cost than just producing the product - everything that costs or produces money
Income Statement
* Operating Income
   * See: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingincome.asp 
   * Operating income takes a company's gross income, which is equivalent to total revenue minus cost of goods sold (COGS), and subtracts all operating expenses.
* Operating Income vs Net Income (Earnings)
   * See: https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/122414/what-difference-between-operating-income-and-net-income.asp 
   * Operating income is revenue less any operating expenses, while net income is operating income less any other non-operating expenses, such as interest and taxes.
* Dividends 
   * Paid out to investors instead of the company keeping the money
   * The money moves out on the ex-dividend date
      * The stock literally dips on this date by the percentage of the dividend to be paid out divided by the current stock price
      * Selling a call just before or selling a put just after this is genius
      * A calendar of such dates is here:

Interest

Technical Analysis (watching)
Higher Highs and Lower Lows
As stocks start to go up you will see it start with higher lows and then eventually higher highs.
Volumes Role
If there is a big move such as the stock going up, then it doesn’t mean much unless there is a lot of volume with it.
   * No volume means that there was no one selling. Large volume means that lots of buying was going on.
MACD
When you see that a fast MA cross the slower moving average up or the MACD signal (fast - slow) has gone positive that is a buy signal as the trend has reversed and we are now heading up… and vice versa.
RSI
Anything over 70 is generally considered overvalued, or very expensive. Anything under 30 is considered undervalues, or very cheap.


If we see that the RSI is bouncing around above 70 and then we get two peaks where we have a lower high in the RSI and yet the price is still moving up, then this is considered bearish.

Velocity of Money
The velocity of Money
   * https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V
   * The velocity of money is a measure of how many times the average single dollar will be re-spent in the economy before getting locked up in someone's bank account or invested and not spent anymore
Equities
The SEC labels 
   * cryptocurrencies as an Asset, just like a house
   * common stocks as a Security


There are different regulations for securities vs assets.
...what are some of those?
...securities are allowed options etc. but assets are not?


The wash-sale rule 
The wash-sale rule is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulation that prevents a taxpayer from taking a tax deduction for a security sold in a wash sale. The rule defines a wash sale as one that occurs when an individual sells or trades a security at a loss and, within 30 days before or after this sale, buys a "substantially identical" stock or security, or acquires a contract or option to do so.

Dollar shortage for other countries? So they switch to Bitcoin


In some countries people just need a way to transact. A lot of poor people don’t have banks (i.e. are unbanked) yet they have cell phones, which is all they need to use bitcoin. In these poor countries they cannot get access to cash or currency they can transact with. All that is missing is for them to learn how to use bitcoin.
Production
We see oil production is way down and they aren’t brining operations back on line
Oil prices are rising as supply is low
Labor market hurt so bad they cannot find work?
Do they anticipate that the demand will stay low?


Known Cause and Effects


Natural disasters will hit insurance companies


War will spike Oil demand


If you find a product that is selling very well, then you can invest in the company, and in the suppliers of the product as they are all getting a piece of the action. Sometimes the percentage gains will weigh better for one than the other.
Unemployment
Is it that people want too much / companies aren’t willing to pay the price for new hires?
   * Perhaps the companies cannot afford to pay the employees?
   * Now that prices have gone up, do people need more money to justify going back to work?
   * Higher prices means a company is paying more for their parts and the things they have to buy to operate
   * Higher prices means companies will increase their prices to keep their profits up
Is it that people just don’t want to go back?
Is it that people prefer the extra free money and prefer to just collect unemployment?

Are we in a bubble?
Ray Dalio are we in a bubble for the 6 checklist items
   * Prices are high relative to traditional measures
   * P/Es high i.e. yields low
   * What are multiples? Stock 70 bonds 50
   * Prices are discounting unsustainable condition
   * Who is doing the buying?
   * Can the buying be sustained?
   * New buyers have entered the market
   * There is broad bullish sentiment
   * Everyone is getting excited
   * Purchases are being financed by high leverage
   * Buyers/Businesses have made extended forwarded purchases
   * Buy inventory to protect against prices going up
The charts that Dalio uses for this would’ve predicted 2000 and 1929 crashes
Using the long-term debt cycle chart would’ve predicted the 2008 crash


Lot’s of new IPOs is also a sign of a bubble

Debt Cycle
The latter part of the cycle is where we have Debt Monetization - Debt monetization or monetary financing is the practice of a government borrowing money from the central bank to finance public spending instead of selling bonds to the private sector or raising taxes.


A lot of selling bonds, and they don’t give any returns, and they are negative real rate.
There will not be enough demand for those bonds and interest rates rise
Currently get 1.68% (2 months ago), now 1.25%


The government creates bonds, the fed controls the money and steps in to buy these
   * If other countries start to sell bonds because they think the dollar is going to crash
   * The fed will step in and start buying these bonds
   * The fed won’t default because it has the printing press?
   * The US gov’t could default on payments
   * The US bond holders will get screwed
   * Watch the swiss franc
   * If they raise the rate it will crush the housing market
   * The CPI numbers are missing a lot of stuff…
   * This leads to
   * If the wages, because people won’t go to work, then the prices of our goods will go up
   * Does the CPI numbers track unit prices or box prices?
   * Less sheets
   * Less corn flakes
   * Bigger Box
   * Price stays the same
   * … this is still inflation, just hidden


They could raise interest rates to attract buyers, but then this pulls money out of the economy 
   * This hurts financial asset prices
   * First bond prices fall
   * Seconds stock prices fall
   * Then the economy
   * People stop taking money out of the banks because of high interest rates
   * People save money and put it into bonds etc. because of high interest rates
If nobody buys bonds, then print more money and buy them yourself
   * This creates a spike in the money supply which causes inflation


When there is an economic downturn the fed hits the gas and creates debt expansion, this happens in three phases
   * Lower interest rates to get people to take loans, so they have money, and thus they spend it -> economy goes up
   * When we hit zero interest rates you cannot keep going lower
   * In 1932 we hit zero
   * In 2009
   * Print money and buy financial assets
   * 2008/2009
   * 1932
   * Injected money doesn’t trickle down, and the banks holds the money as excess reserves
   * But are they choosing to do this or is there nobody to buy it?
   * Todays we’re seeing this and people aren’t taking the loans
   * Is it due to people not able to service the debt they have today?
   * We can calculate the ratio of debt to GDP or some other metrics to determine if we’ve hit this limit - people won’t take on more debt after this
   * Is it because of supply chain problems and people cannot buy the things they would normally spend money on?
   * Is it because housing prices have hit such highs? If people cannot buy houses (even at low interest rates) because the prices are so high they could not service the debt of a house they would normally get, then…
   * We will see prices come down because demand will drop
   * We will see interest rates keep dropping until zero
   * The FED works with the government, monetary and fiscal policy align
   * This is the late part of the cycle
   * This is what is driving the economy now


In the 1940s we created the Brenton Woods monetary system i.e. the new world order (stocks etc.)




Are we going to crash or boom (real estate)?
Step #1
   1. Wages - what do we think wages will do?
   1. Stimulus checks
   2. https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker 
   2. Expenses
   3. Rates
   1. 20-40 year cycles, right now we are super low
   4. Demographics
   1. Household formation: will there be more or less couples making a home etc.
   2. Are we going to have demand?
   3. Females wages are going up and Males are flat
   1. Hypergamy - Females prefer to marry at same or if man is higher
   5. Supply
   1. Mortgage Forbearance
   1. This is supposed to be ending in October
   2. This will flood the market with foreclosures
   3. These are only the ones that were from 1 year ago - forbearance ends 1 year from when you got it, so this isn’t like all homes will hit the market in October, November, or December (as the foreclosure process will take time), but the will start to hit the market in this time frame and keep on coming for 1 year
   2. Building
   1. Material costs: have gone way up so this is slowing
   1. Are materials supply increasing or decreasing?
   2. Regulations: are policies being made that will increase or decrease supply?
   3. Asset Prices
   1. Retirees have a lot of their money in the stock market
   2. If the S&P 500 goes way down, then they may not have enough money, so they need to sell their houses
   4. Zillow Data Sets
   1. The Zillow data sets are showing that housing inventory is growing and has been in large part across the country for the last 3 weeks (8/20/2021)
https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ 
This trend continues, but the growth of inventory on the market is slowing (9/19/2021)
Jobless rate went way up, so we would’ve expected prices to go down, but because of stimulus etc. the prices went up
Step #2 - The big picture drives all of the prices
GFC : If something goes wrong with the banks, then all asset prices are impacted
The banking collateral today is mostly treasuries
      * Before the GFC it was mostly MBS that was used as banking collateral
Step #3 - 
Purchasing power
      * How many big macs can I buy if I sell my house?

As more people buy bonds (demand rises) the price goes up and the interest rate goes down.

2. Term to maturity
3. Quality of the bond

Options
Entry and exits at any time? + costs
      * Can you be called out to close the position (if no margin is involved)?
      * Yes, it’s only in the interest of the party holding the contract to force you to exercise while in the money
      * If you hold the option until close what happens will it automatically be executed if in the money?
      * No it will expire and be worthless
      * You must execute the option before it expires to purchase the shares from the other party
      * This depends on the brokerage, TDAmertrade will execute if in the money


Each option is a contract made with 100 shares of the underlying asset.


Premiums are very inflated just before earnings


Stock price drops on ex-dividend date by the amount of the dividends
      * Dividends 
      * Paid out to investors instead of the company keeping the money
      * The money moves out on the ex-dividend date
      * The stock literally dips on this date by the percentage of the dividend to be paid out divided by the current stock price
      * Selling a call just before or selling a put just after this is genius
      * A calendar of such dates is here:

For Options…
         * Delta (price)
         * How much does the options premium change if the underlying changes by 1 dollar?
         * For instance
         * Delta is 0.40
         * If price goes from 13.00 -> 14.00
         * Then option premium goes from 1.00 -> 1.40
         * The most this can be is a 1.00 and the smallest is -1.00 and it will never actually get to these values as it indicates that the options premium is actually almost moving in a 1:1 with the price of the stock
         * Represents the odds of this option expiring in the money
         * For instance
         * Delta is 0.40
         * Has a 40% chance of expiring ITM
         * 1-0.4 = 0.6 or 60% chance of expiring OTM
         * ?This is the first derivative of the price?
         * Gamma (price)
         * The rate at which delta changes
         * Delta changes as the price moves
         * For instance
         * Gamma is 0.05 and Delta is 0.40
         * If price goes from 13.00 -> 14.00
         * Then option premium goes from 2.00 -> 2.40
         * Then delta changes to 0.45
         * If price goes from 14.00 -> 15.00
         * Then option premium goes from 1.40 -> 1.85
         * Theta (time)
         * time decay
         * For instance 
         * Theta is -0.04
         * The premium goes down by 0.04 every day
         * Vega
         * Measures implied volatility, vega estimates how much the premium may change with each (1) percentage change in implied volatility
         * For instance
         * Options price: $2.00
         * Vega is 0.03
         * If implied volatility drops by 1%
         * Then option premium goes down to $1.97

         * Gamma 0.06
         * Theta -0.02
         * Vega 0.07
         * Day 1 -> 2
         * Price moves from $45 -> $46
         * Premium action
         * Delta causes an increase from $1.30 -> $1.65 
         * Theta causes a decrease from $1.65 -> $1.63
         * Day 2 -> 3
         * Price moves from $46 -> $47
         * Premium action
         * Delta increases from 0.35 to 0.41
         * Delta causes an increase from $1.63 -> $2.04 
         * Theta causes a decreases from $2.04 -> $2.02
         * Implied volatility increases by 1%
         * Vega causes an increase from $2.02 -> $2.09
Puts
Concept
A put is a contract that gives one party the right to force another party to buy an underlying asset at a specified price.


To close a position a couple of things can happen:
         * If you bought a put
         * you can sell the same put to close (it will probably be at a different premium which you’d get paid for)
         * you can execute the option and force the selling party to buy shares from you
         * If you sold the put and the option is executed then you are said to be put into assignment (assignment to buy the underlying asset)
         * If you sold a put
         * you can buy the same put to close (it will probably be at a different premium which you’d have to pay)
Cash Secured Put
Is where your cash is locked up as collateral to buy the underlying asset.


See also: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_rKof8IdfU 
Example


S0 = Current Price = $26
K = Strike Price = $25
P = Premium = $0.50
Exp = Expiration Date = 10/2


This option is said to be “out of the money” (OTM). The buying party will not want to exercise it.
         * If they did close this, then they must buy the stock at market price and sell it to the party which sold them the put option for a higher price.


Therefore, if the current price stays above the strike price (S0 >= K), then the contract should never get executed. This means that the party that sold the put contract gets to keep the premium and no other action happens.
Outcome 1/4: Expires OTM


In this example…
         * the premium is 100 * $0.50 = $50
         * If executed, then the party selling the put would be forced to buy the underlying asset from the party buying the put for: 100 * $25 = $2500
         * The party selling the put will have $2500 locked up as collateral


If the current price goes to $24 (below the strike price), then the option is said to be “in the money” (ITM). The buying party can exercise it at any time.
         * If the buying party closes the position ITM, then they will be selling the stock to the other party at a price above market value. If they did this, then they can buy the shares from the market and sell it to the selling party for more money and keep the difference.
Outcome 2/4: Assignment
         * The owner of the put contract does not have to force you to close the position immediately
            * The closer to the expiration the more likely the option will be exercised if it is in the money
            * The deeper in the money the option is the more likely it will be exercised
            * As time goes on the premium goes down, this is called theta decay or the time value of the contract

	Price falls to $23
	Unrealized loss:

Profit: $200 - $50 = $150

	Realized profit:

Profit: $2200 - $50 = $2150
	

NOTES: 
            * The party selling the put general would be Okay owning the stock at the strike price - the premium, but if the market price goes way up, then they may have been better just buying and holding the stock and this is what is marked as “opportunity cost” above
            * The current market price is $23 and the seller of the put option would be forced to buy the stocks at the strike price of $25, so this is an unrealized loss as they haven’t lost the money until they sell the shares. The party buying the put immediately realizes the gain as they have to buy the shares from the market and sell them to the selling party and their position will be closed out with profits realized.


Rolling a Put
If you sold a put, then you can purchase the same contract which will effectively close your position, and you can then sell another put with a lower strike price.
Outcome 3/4: Roll your Position


This is useful if you sold a put and it’s gone into the money, and your goal is to just keep collecting premium and try to prevent assignment.


Sold Put 1
	Buy Put 1
	Sold Put 2
	K = $25
P = $0.50 * 100 = $50
Exp = 10/2
Profit: $50
	K = $21
P = $1.50 * 100 = $150
Exp = 10/2
Profit: $50 - $150 = -$100
	K = $19
P = $2.00 * 100 = $200
Exp = 11/28
Profit: -$100 + $200 = $100
	

Buying to Close
If you sold a put, then you can purchase the same contract which will effectively close your position.
Outcome 4/4: Buy to Close


This is useful if you want to free up the collateral.


Sold Put
	Buy Put (to Close)
	K = $25
P = $1.00 * 100 = $100
Exp = 10/2
Profit: $100
	K = $25
P = $0.20 * 100 = $20
Exp = 10/2
Profit: $100 - $20 = $80
	

Calls
Concept
A call is a contract that gives one party the right to force another party to sell an underlying asset at a specified price.


To close a position a couple of things can happen:
            * If you bought a call
            * you can sell the same call to close (it will probably be at a different premium which you’d get paid for)
            * you can execute the option and force the selling party to sell shares to you
            * If you sold the call and the option is executed then you are said to be put into ?assignment? (assignment to sell the underlying asset)
            * If you sold a call
            * you can buy the same call to close (it will probably be at a different premium which you’d have to pay)
Covered Calls
Calls can be sold using margin, this is risky. If you sell a call and own the underlying asset, then this is a covered call i.e. it is not being done on margin.


See also: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnTsQBJHMSk&t=5s 
Example


S0 = Current Price = $50
K = Strike Price = $55
P = Premium = $0.50
Exp = Expiration Date = 10/2


This option is said to be “out of the money” (OTM). The buying party will not want to exercise it.
            * If they did close this, then they must buy the stock from the party which sold them the call option at the strike price which is higher than the market price


Therefore, if the current price stays below the strike price (S0 <= K), then the contract should never get executed. This means that the party that sold the call contract gets to keep the premium and no other action happens.
Outcome 1/4: Expires OTM


In this example…
            * the premium is 100 * $0.50 = $50
            * If executed, then the party selling the call would be forced to sell the underlying asset to the party buying the call for: 100 * $55 = $5500
            * The party selling the call will have 100 shares locked up as collateral (yes they should own them)


If the current price goes to $60 (above the strike price), then the option is said to be “in the money” (ITM). The buying party can exercise ?it at any time - how I don’t see this when I buy, how do you assign?.
            * If the buying party closes the position ITM, then they will be buying the stock from the other party at a price below market value. If they did this, then they can keep the shares or sell them immediately and keep the difference.
Outcome 2/4: Assignment
            * The owner of the call contract does not have to force you to close the position immediately (?They can though right?)
               * The closer to the expiration the more likely the option will be exercised if it is in the money
               * The deeper in the money the option is the more likely it will be exercised
               * As time goes on the premium goes down, this is called theta decay or the time value of the contract

This loss is realized because they sold their shares at the strike price and their position is closed.
               * The current market price is $50 and the buyer of the call option would buy the stocks at the strike price of $55, so this is an unrealized profit as they haven’t gained the money until they sell the shares. The party selling the call immediately realizes the gain as they have to sell the shares to the buying party and their position will be closed out with loss realized.
Making it Simple
A put is the option for someone to make someone else pay for a stock at an agreed price
               * The seller is betting the price will stay flat or go down
               * The buyer is betting the price will go up
A call is the option for someone to make someone else cash out of a stock at an agreed price
               * The seller is betting the price will stay flat or go up
               * The buyer is betting the price will go down


If you sell an option you get paid for it
If you buy an option you must pay for it


Selling options is wanting them to be OTM

Long vs Short


Going long on a stock is betting the share price of a stock will go up
               * This is done by buying and holding the stock


Going short on a stock is betting the share price of a stock will go down
               * This is done by selling the stock without owning it
               * WARNING: This is dangerous as if the stock price goes way up you will have to buy those shares at any price to pay the owed shares back - this is an unlimited loss situation


Buying a call or a put option is considered going long
               * Buying a put - betting price will go down (bearish)
               * option buyer can buy the shares cheap from market and sell it to the put option seller
               * Buying a call - betting price will go up (bullish)
               * option buyer can buy the shares cheap from the call option seller and sell it to the market


Selling a call or a put option is considered going short

Sell 1% growth per week on SPY


Check how much our wheel strategy would have lost if having 4..8 SPY open options cascaded week by week during the covid dip




LEAPS
Long-term Equity AnticiPation Securities
It’s buying options that are very deep ITM and a very far out expiration call.
It’s almost like owning the underlying as it has a delta very close to 1.0:
               * A delta of 1.0 means that as the underlying changes by $1 the premium changes by $1
This is beneficial because you don’t have to get in using the same amount of capital - option entry is much less


Downside: 
               * If you are wrong and the underlying moves OTM you can lose 100% of what was put into the option, vs. if just owning the stock then it is generally just a percentage loss
The Wheel Strategy
a.k.a. The triple income strategy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siFsIleNTzk 
               1. Sell a Cash Secured Put (CSP)
               1. This should be a security you are Okay owning long
               2. It should be trading at a discount in case you get assigned
               3. We don’t want to be assigned
               4. We want a 70% chance it stays out of the money
               5. If Delta is -0.3223, then this is ~68% it will remain out of the money
               6. Choose expiration 30-45 days out
               1. At this point time decay starts to ramp up exponentially
               2. Avoid & Roll
               1. Avoid letting it come into the money
               2. Roll the put to keep it OTM 
               3. Sometimes you have to keep rolling it out further and further to make 
               4. Eventually you cannot roll anymore
               3. Get Assigned
               4. Sell Covered Call (CC)
               5. Avoid & Roll
               6. Get Assigned
               7. Start over, go to step 1


Cost Basis (K = $25)
               * Sell CSP
               * Receive $500 as credit / premium
               * Assigned
               * $2500 -> $25 per share
               * Cost Basis
               * Is how much we paid for the shares
               *                * $2500 - $500 = $2000 (~$20/share)
               * Sell Covered Call above here if possible
               * Why?
               * Cost Basis: $20/share <- $2000
               * Covered Call: K = $19 <- $1900
               * This leads to $100 loss
               * This is why we don’t want to sell below our cost basis
               * Instead…
               * Cost Basis: $20/share <- $2000
               * Covered Call: K = $21 <- $2100
               * This leads to $100 profit

               * >= 3 months out
               * High liquidity
               * It will be expensive, but will be cheaper than buying the stock
               * Has a low theta, low ?
               * We want a lot of liquidity since we are so deep in the money
               * Bid asks should be tight

Options Examples
Sell a Put
Example 1
This is selling a put
               * Buying power $3533.31
               * 30-45 days out
               * Selling out out of the money
               * $25 put premium $0.70
               * Premium = $70
               * Collateral = $2500
               * New Buying Power = $1103.49
               * Difference: ($2,500 + $1,103.49) - $3,533.31 = $69.98 ($0.02 in fees)


It’s also interesting that you can set the premium price. This means that if you are far away from the current bid/ask, then you may have to wait for a fill on the option. This can happens as the price moves to a point where the bid/ask move through your premium.
Rolling the Position


Tap on the already sold put > trade > view all options
               * It shows the options and has a -1 next to the option we already sold (i.e. we are -1)
               * Click on Select
               * pick the one we already sold
and
               * Go forward and select one in the future and pick one that is more out of the money
                  * It’s worth more because of the time value
                  * Click on the option to move forward
                  * It should show a Total Credit (i.e. not Debit)
                  * Example 2
This is selling a put
                  * SOFI > Selling a Put on 7/8/2021 with date of January 2023
                  * Current price is : $16.66
                  * Strike price is: $17.50
                  * Don’t have to pay this in cash, but must have it in margin at a minimum
                  * Credit: $7.45
                  * Get to keep this and it is paid immediately when someone buys the contract
                  * Will effectively buy at $10.05
                  * If SOFI doubles to $35
                  * Lost opportunity to have the $16.66 purchase go to $35
                  * The option will not be exercised as it’s out of the money
                  * Made $186,250
                  * Could’ve been $437,500 / $16.66 = 26,260 shares
                  * 26,260 * $35 = $919,100
                  * ROI: $919,100/$437,500 = 210.08%
                  * vs 42.5%
                  * If SOFI goes to $0
                  * Must still pay the $17.50
                  * All $437,500 would be lost 
                  * $186,250 would be retained (as a credit)
                  * Loss would be 57.5%
                  * Sold 250 contracts
                  * 250 * 100 * $7.45 = $186,250 made as a credit
                  * 250 * 100 * $17.50 = $437,500 needed to close the position
                  * $7.45 / $17.50 = 42.5% of purchase prices is paid as an almost immediate credit
                  * Let’s take this a step further and use the cash we got and 


If you sell a put option - you are giving the right to someone else to force you to buy the stock at a certain price.
                  * If the stock is down, then puts are more expensive
                  * Open today $17.57 > $17.04 at time of writing (SOFI)
                  * 250 put options for January 2023 at a $17.5 strike for SOFI
                  * Worst case, buy $437,500 of SoFi (100 * 250 * $17.50)
                  * Received $186,500 for doing the trade ($7.5 * 250)
                  * If it goes down to $15, then sell more puts


Things are a little pricey
                  * ENPH $181
                  * CCIV $25, TSLA is struggling right now, so they really are

Buy a Put
This is buying a promise that someone else will sell you a stock 


If you buy a put option - you are given the right to force someone else to buy the stock from you at a given price.
                  * If the stock is down, then puts are more expensive
                  * If the stock price goes does


Sell a Call
Example 1
This is selling a covered call
                  * Buy 100 shares of AMD 2018/3/1 @ $11.85 ($1185.00)
                  * Sell call
                  * Premium = $0.17 * 100 = $17
                  * This $0.17 was the natural (I think this is the premium ask price)
                  * Collateral = 100 shares
                  * Strike = $13 = cash if exercised $1300
                  * Exp = 2018/3/16
                  * Stock price went down to $11.48  ($1148 - $1185 = -$37)
                  * However, we got $17 from the premium 
                  * Our realized loss then is -$20 instead of -$37


It’s also interesting that you can set the premium price. This means that if you are far away from the current premium bid/ask, then you may have to wait for a fill on the option. This can happen as the price moves to a point where the option premium will move through your set premium.


Trading stocks works because there is a market
If you buy the price moves up to those waiting with a limit sell order (i.e. making the market)
If you sell the price moves down to those waiting with a limit buy order


Total Stock Market Value is Inaccurate (right?)
The value of American Express is and BRK is added to the total stock market value. What value exists that accounts for these 


Value is being double counted right?


Trading moves price more than 
If you look at BTC buying $1B dollars of it will move the price from $33k to $41k
(see pro.coinbase.com or …) and yet with the 18.6 million BTC in the universe this will move the total market capitalization from $613.8B to $762.6B, this is a delta in $148.8B


This is how we turn $1B into $148.8B


Now this doesn’t account for the fact that there could be people waiting in the wings or that have computers setup to move in, but the visibly available market says this
Nominal and Real 
Can mean small, but...
Means not-adjusted (i.e. generally for interest rates or GDP)
Real interest rate = nominal interest rate + inflation rate
If inflation rate is 2% and bond nominal interest rate is 1.5%, then real rate is -0.5%


The Federal Reserve (a.k.a The Fed)
The fed is not the government. The fed is the US Central Bank


US Treasury Securities


                  * T-Bills : 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 13 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks
                  * T-Notes : 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years currently available
                  * T-Bonds : More than 10 years, currently 30 years
                  * TIPS Notes/Bonds : Medium or long-term 2-30 years
                  * FRN - Medium-term floating rate notes can buy these at TreasuryDirect.gov, and can view the auctions and prices: https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/instit.htm?upcoming


Created to address 2 things:


                  * prevent bank runs
                  * control monetary policy


The fed has 3 goals:


                  * maximum employment
                  * stable prices
                  * moderate long-term interest rates This really comes down to 2 things:
                  * inflation
                  * Unemployment


How money works


                  * Gov't spends, and needs money
                  * Gov't borrows money from a Primary Dealer (PD) which is a designated bank from the Federal Reserve
                  * the PD will buy bonds from the gov't (gov't get's cash and PD has bonds)
                  * the fed will then buy the bond from the PD using printed money
                  * the printed money goes to the PD and the bond goes to the fed
                  * The gov't spending goes out to employees and businesses
                  * the people deposit this earned money into the banks
                  * the banks loan this money out


3 Tools


                  * Discount rate - what the fed charges banks for loans when they make collateralized loans usually overnight to depository institutions (banks, savings and loans, and credit unions)
                  * set by the Board of Governors
                  * the federal funds rate is what a bank pays the federal reserve for a loan
                  * decreasing the discount rate will make it easier for banks to borrow increasing money supply / increasing the discount rate will make banks not want to borrow decreasing the money supply
                  * the federal funds rate is the interest rate that depository institutions charge each other for overnight loans and this money is generally used to hit reserve requirements, set by the market between bank members
                  * banks will use this if they need money and aren't ?part of the fed system?
                  * the FOMC will set a target fed funds rate which it pursues through the open sale and purchase of US treasuries (t-notes/bonds?)
                  * Open market operations - the purchase and sale of securities in the open market
                  * fed buy or sell short term government bonds (t-bills ... treasury bills)
                  * do they force the banks to do this or they just post that they are buying/selling t-bills from
                  * the fed can buy previously issues bonds from banks, this increases the banks liquidity (because they get cash) and increases the money supply
                  * Change the reserve ratio (reserve requirement) - how much cash must a bank hold against deposits
                  * banks hold this
                  * decreasing reserve requirement will increase the money supply / increasing reserves will decrease money supply 


New tools (open market)


                  * Quantitative easing (QE)
                  * it often means the fed swaps money for things other than T-Bills
                  * bought things like home loans (mortgage backed securities)
                  * buying these long term bonds reduces the long term rate
                  * lowering the long term rate lowers the short term rate
                  * this lets them change different interest rates and focus on specific parts of the economy
                  * for instance directly buying T-10 (10 year treasury bonds) will reduce the interest rate
                  * another is mortgage backed securities which then > this will lead to lower mortgage interest rates
                  * increases the banks reserves and this increases liquidity
                  * since 2008 $2b -> $2.7t today (total bank reserves)
                  * banks had so much money now, they weren't as dependent on the federal reserve
                  * this meant the fed had to rely on other tools
                  * interest rates are close to 0, people won't swap to treasury notes as those are also 0
                  * Interest on reserves (IOR)
                  * pay interest for notes held at the reserve, this makes the banks want to buy more of these
                  * since this is risk free they won't loan as much and will just keep it
                  * this is to stop the lowering of the fed rate as they do QE, because the banks can get this IOR from the fed o it acts as a way to stop the fed rate from going down as they lower the long term rates with QE
                  * Reserve repurchase (repo) agreements: fed sends t-bills and receives reserves
                  * repurchase agreements: overnight loan (swap) $ for t bills fed sends USD (reserves) to banks and receives t-bills
                  * as a means to help keep the federal funds rate in the target range set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).
                  * the central
                  * this is like controlling the money supply
                  * these are viewed as temporary
                  * these are banks that are out of the fed system o these banks were willing to make loans for even cheaper than the other banks o this is because they could not keep their money at the fed and get the risk free IOR
                  * the fed says we will buy these banks reserves (reverse repo), even though they don't play in the fed system
                  * this effectively gives the fed control over the whole market
                  * this prevents any banks from wanting to lend below the IOR
                  * fed takes money and gives the t-bills @ IOR rate




T-Bills - Treasury notes - these are just bonds?
    Buy the bill wait 4 weeks and you get your interest
    This is exempt from state and local tax - must still pay federal taxes






The fed can change the rate it let's banks borrow money
The banks want to make money so they will generally be just slightly above this rate
- Is this the prime rate?


By lowering the interest rate


- Who gets to pick when they print money?


- I heard the gov't was buying public company bonds and next it would buy equities (stocks?) directly, is the fed
  involved with this?
- They are now giving this money directly to the people too with stimulus, right?
Monetary and Fiscal policy are now combined
- How do we get out of this mess?


The supply that is in circulation, in the US cannot be taken back?


- Does the fed ever reduce the money supply?
    - yes, this is called contractionary monetary policy
    - Do they ever take money and destroy it? Guess: they just incentivise banks to hold money or give it to the fed
    this effectively reduces the money supply


Monetary Policy - what the fed does
* change the money supply
Fiscal Policy - the gov't
* Changing gov't spending or taxes


MDS


They set a range 2.25-2.5%
If the rate is higher then banks want to put money into the bank
If the rate is lower the banks want to pull the money out...


3 key entities:
* 1 governing body w/ 7 people: Federal Reserve Board of Governors - there is a Chair position which is Jerome Powel (was Janet Yellen, Ben Bernake, etc.)
* There are 12 regional banks that act as the fed (each is a Federal Reserve Bank)
* ?Each bank has a governor (one is the chair)? and are a 14-year term
* Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
Each regional reserve bank acts as a private corporation
?Each bank is required to keep 6% of it's capital in the federal reserve bank?
They receive an equivalent number of shares? Are these the T-Notes?
They are $100 per share and cannot be sold or traded?
They carry voting rights to 2/3 of the board of directors?
Fixed 6% dividend per year - if the fed makes more than this, then it goes directly into the treasury (?gov't?)
* in 2017 $80b went to treasure and $13.8b when to the banks
150 pages of companies - all American banks
Ownership in the fed is based on ownership of the reserve bank - the biggest bank makes the most and has the most control
> This has historically been J.P. Morgan who also helped setup the fed




8/30/2021 @ 11a - Crash? Casgains academy joke


FED is saying they will start selling corporate bonds and corporate ETDs which were acquired in the pandemic


Dalio says that the FED will be forced to purchase bonds

“The Intelligent Investor”
https://jensenloke.medium.com/my-notes-on-the-intelligent-investor-942224d74614
Chapter 1 - Investment versus speculation; results to be expected by the Intelligent Investor…
An investment operation is one which upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return.
Investing consists of 3 elements
You must thoroughly analyse a company, and the soundness of its underlying business before you buy its stock
You must deliberately protect yourself against serious losses
You must aspire to “adequate” and not extraordinary performance
Invest only if you would be comfortable owning a stock even if you had no way of knowing its daily share price.
Do not get confused between speculation and investing. Don’t think you are investing when you are speculating. It becomes dangerous when you take it seriously. You must put strict limits on the amount you are willing to wager.
Chapter 2 - The investor and inflation…
It is important to measure your investing success not just by what you make, but by how much you keep after inflation.
Be on guard against what is unexpected and underestimated. Inflation is tied to stock returns and when inflation fluctuates stocks do too.
REITs are a good way to combat the effects of inflation that maintains purchasing power without hampering overall returns
Chapter 3 - A Century of Stock-Market History…
No borrowing to buy or hold securities
No increase in the proportion of funds held in common stocks
A reduction in common stock holdings where needed to bring it down to a maximum of 50 percent of the total portfolio. The capital gains tax must be paid with as good grace as possible, and the proceeds invested in first quality bonds or held as a savings deposit.
By the rule of the opposites; the more enthusiastic investors become about the stock market in the Long run, the more certain they are to be proved wrong in the short run.
Future returns depend on three things minus the noise
Real growth (the rise of companies earnings and dividends)
Inflationary growth (the general rise of prices throughout the economy)
Speculative growth – or decline (any increase or decrease in the investing public’s appetite for stocks)
Chapter 4 - General Portfolio Policy; the defensive investor…
There are two ways to be an intelligent investor
Continually researching, selecting and monitoring a dynamic mix of stocks, bonds or mutual funds
Or by creating a permanent portfolio that runs in autopilot and requires no further effort (but generates very little excitement)
Conventional wisdom: subtract your age from 100 and put that percentage in stocks, with the rest in bonds or cash, but this is situational and depends on individual!
Think about the fundamental circumstances of your life (incoming big expenses, magnitude of wealth) before deciding your mix. Some of these include
Are you single, married, do you have children? Do you have to be responsible for parents?
Career? Type of employment? Do you need it to supplement your income? Bonds might be better in that case
How much can you afford to lose?
Chapter 5 - The defensive investor and common stocks…
“Should you buy what you know?”
Popularised by Peter Lynch – the power of the common knowledge. Lynch’s rule only works if you follow its corollary as well: “Finding the promising company is only the first step. The next step is doing the research” no one should invest in a company, no matter how great its products or how crowded its parking lot, without studying its financial statements and estimating its business value.”
Becoming more familiar with a subject does not significantly reduce it people’s tendency to exaggerate how much they actually know about it. The more you know going in, the less likely you are to probe a stock for weaknesses. This is “home bias”. Familiarity breeds complacency.
Graham’s guide to own between 10–30 stocks remains a good starting point for those who wants to build their own portfolio
Dollar cost averaging – buy a fixed amount into index funds every month as a defensive investor. 12,000 at one go vs 100 a month. For 10 years yields very different results on the snp 500. From Sep 1929 to Aug 1939
Chapter 6 - Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach..
Don’t just do something, stand there. A Long term investor is the only kind of investor there is. Someone who can’t hold on to stocks for more than a few months at a time is doomed to end up not as a victor but a victim.
Chapter 7 - Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side…
Buying in Low markets and selling in high
Buying carefully chosen “growth stocks”
Buying bargain issues of various types
Buying into “special situations”
Why not just outright pick the best performers to form your portfolio? Common stocks with good records and good prospects sell at correspondingly high prices. The investor may be right in his judgement of their prospects and still not fare particularly well, merely because he has paid in full for the expected prosperity. Second is because growth will eventually plateau because repetition is more difficult.
Chapter 8 - The Investor and Market Fluctuations…
We favour some kind of mechanical method for varying the proportion of bonds to stocks in the investor’s portfolio. The chief advantage is that it will give him something to do. When the market proceeds, he will make sales of his stockholdings, putting it into bonds, as it declines he will reverse the procedure. These activities provide outlet for his otherwise too pent up energies. If he is the right kind of investor he will take added satisfaction that his operations are exactly opposite from those of the crowd.
2 chief morals of the A&P case study. The stock market often goes far wrong, and sometimes an alert and courageous investor can take advantage of its patent errors. The other is that most business change in character and quality over the years, sometimes for the better, perhaps more often for the worse. The investor need not watch his companies performance like a hawk, but should give it a good, hard look from time to time.
Liquidity of the stock market really means is
The investor has the benefit of the stock markets daily and changing appraisals of his holdings, for whatever that appraisal might be worth, and
second, that the investor is able to increase or decrease his investment at the market’s daily figure if he chooses. Investor can take his source of value from another source if he chooses.
Markets are only good for timing, but It is better off paying attention to dividend returns and to the operating results of his companies.
What is under your control
Your brokerage cost; by trading rarely, patiently, and cheaply
Your ownership cost, by refusing to buy mutual funds with excessive annual expenses
Your expectations, by using realism, not fantasy to forecast your returns
Your risk, by deciding how much of your total assets to put at hazard in the stock market, by diversifying and rebalancing
Your tax bills, by holding stocks for at least one hear and whenever possible, for at least 5 years to lower your capital gains liability
And most of all, your own behaviour.
Buy every month, automatically, and whenever you can spare some money. Sell only when you need cash.
Our brains are designed to perceive trends, even when they might not exist.
Chapter 9 - Investing in Funds…
When should you sell a fund?
A sharp and unexpected change in strategy; such as a “value” fund loafing up on tech stocks in 1999 or a “growth” fund buying tons of insurance stocks in 2002
An increase in expense, suggesting that managers are lining their own pockets
Large and frequent tax bills; generated by excessive trading
Sudden erratic returns, as when a formerly conservative fund generates a big loss (or even produces a giant gain)
“If you’re not prepared to stay married, you shouldn’t get married.” ~ Charles Ellis. If you’re not prepared to stick with a fund through at least 3 lean years, you shouldn’t buy it in the first place.
Chapter 10 - The Investor and His Advisors…
If the investor is to rely chiefly on the advise of others handing his funds, then either he must limit himself and his advisers strictly to standard, conservative, and even unimaginative forms of investment, or he must have an unusually intimate and favourable knowledge of the person who is going to direct his funds into other channels.
But if the ordinary business or professional relationship exists between the investor and his Advisors, he can be receptive to less conventional suggestions only to the extent that he himself has grown in knowledge and experience, and therefore become competent to pass independent judgement on the recommendation of others. He has then passed from the category of defensive investor to aggressive investor.
If your advisories are a line of defense between you and your worst impulsive tendencies, then he or she should have systems in place to help you control them.
A comprehensive financial plan that outlines how you will earn, save, spend, borrow and invest
An investment policy statement that spells out your fundamental approach to investing
An asset allocation plan that details how much money you will keep in different investment categories
Chapter 11 - Securities Analysis for the Lay Investor: General Approach…

Use the past to predict the future 7 years before and 7 years after. Should be carried out mechanically by applying a formula that gives individual weights to part figures for profitability, stability and growth. The second part of the analysis should consider to what extent the value based solely on past performance should be modified because of new conditions expected in the future.

Growth in ten years
Multiplier of current earnings


Comparison example
What factor determines how much you should be willing to pay for a stock? The five elements are:
The company’s general Long term prospects
The quality of its management
It’s financial strength and capital structure
It’s dividend record
And it’s current dividend rate
Download at least 5 years worth of annual reports and comb thru the statements to help answer two overriding questions.
1) will this company grow?
2) where do profits come from?
Problems to look out for
Serial acquirers: an average of 2–3 acquisitions per year is a sign of trouble. It would rather invest more in other’s business than its own
Company is OPM Addict. “other people’s money”. Keeps raising money from selling stock or debt.
Company is Johnny one note – relying on one customer or a handful for most of its revenues.
Good signs
Company has a wide moat – or competitive advantage. Such as a strong brand identity (Nike, Apple), a monopoly economics of scale (Amazon), intangible asset (Coca cola formula), resistance to substitution (banks, utilities)
Company is a marathoner, not a sprinter. growth rates are controlled at sustainable rates
The company sows and reaps. Companies generally also invests in R&D at a % of sales
The quality and conduct of management (blame culture vs accountability).
Do they do what they say?
Are they looking out for number 1?.. high ceo pays, reevaluating options..
Are they managers or promoters?
Financial strength and capital structure
Any costs of granting stock options which divert earnings away from existing shareholders into the hands of inside owners
Any unusual nonrecurring or extraordinary charges
Any income from company’s pension fund
Long term debt should be < 50% of company’s capital
Look for ratio of earnings to fixed charges
Burden of proof is on company to show that your are better off not paying dividends, if business is still under performing, means managers are misusing cash instead of paying a dividend
Companies should buy back shares when it is cheap, not overpriced
Beware of companies who keep splitting stock
Chapter 12 - Things to Consider for per share earnings..
Use average earnings to negate the effects of special charges and credits over the last 7–10 years
Use the last 3 years to inform of average growth rate.
“Pro forma” earnings enable a company to show how well they might have done if they hadn’t done so badly as they did. As an intelligent investor, the only thing you should do with pro forma earnings is to ignore them.
Hungry for recognition: premature declaration of realised earnings
Capital offences: improper classification of capex instead of operating expense
One time inventory write down
Is net pension benefit more than 5% of the company’s net income?
Read financial reports backwards, anything that company doesn’t want you to find is hidden at the back
Read the notes: and watch for disclosures that can take a huge chunk out of earnings. Look out for terms like ‘capitalized’, ‘deferred’, and ‘restructuring’ and ‘began’, ‘change’ and ‘however’ that shows you need to investigate further. Compare the notes with competitor to see how aggressive the company’s accountants are.

Chapter 13 - Comparing 4 listed companies…
See the book if you care...
Chapter 14 - Stock selection for the defensive investor…
Adequate size of the enterprise (greater than 2B market cap)
A sufficiently strong financial condition; current assets at least twice of current liabilities) working capital is current assets minus current liabilities, long term debt includes preferred stock, excludes tax liabilities.
Earnings stability (10 years)
Dividend record
Earnings growth (increase one third in per share earnings using 3 year averages) not many companies can hit this
Moderate price to earnings ratio ( not more than 15x for the past 3 years average) use Graham’s formula and calculate it yourself!
Moderate price to book ratio; ratio of price to assets (current price should not be more than 1.5 tines the book value) product of the multiplier times the ratio of price to book value should not be greater than 22.5. (15 x 1.5)
In selecting defensive stocks…
Current price reflects both known facts and future expectations was intended to emphasise the double emphasis for market valuations.
Approach the future in the way of prediction and the way of protection.
Predictive is qualitative; emphasizes on prospects, management, and other non measurable, albeit highly important factors that go under the heading of quality
Protective is quantitative; emphasizes the measurable relationships between selling price and earnings, assets, dividends and so forth.
Diversification would be a better approach
Due dilligence
Do your homework; read 5 years worth of financial reports
Check out your neighborhood: if more than 60% is owned by institution it means the stock is over owned or under discovered with a fear of selling in lockstep. If they are firms similar to ur style owning it, it is a good sign.
Chapter 15 - Stock selection for the enterprising investor…
Graham Newman methods
S&P Stock guide: give in separate columns the current dividend yields and P/E ratios for last twelve months
Watch out for prominent companies trading below net asset value per share, and be willing to wait for them to recover
Who’s the boss? Most investors want to see a company run by people who think like owners, not managers. Two test
Is the financial statement easy to understand?
Are there non recurring or extraordinary or unusual charges just that or do they have nasty habit of recurring.
Keep your eyes on the road; see which leading professional money manager own the same stocks you do, and learn from them.
Successful investment professionals have 2 things in common. 1) they are disciplined and consistent, not changing approach even when it is unfashionable 2) they think a great deal about what they do and how to do it, paying little attention to what the market is doing
Chapter 16 - Convertible issues and warrants…
Convertible bonds behave more like stocks than bonds
Warrants are no longer popular today
Probably not going anywhere near this for now..
Chapter 17 - Four extremely instructive case studies…
An overpriced tottering giant
An empire building conglomerate
A merger in which a tiny firm took over a big one
An IPO of shares in a worthless company
Chapter 18 - A comparison between 8 pairs of companies…
comparing pairs of companies help to make things look more grounded and realistic
Any PE ratio much higher than 25 need to be thoroughly justified..
Graham used to say, in the short run the market is like a voting machine, in the Long run a weighing machine, in the case of yum vs yahoo.
If you buy a stock simply because it’s price is going up instead of asking whether the underlying value is increasing, then sooner or later you will be sorry
Chapter 19 - Shareholders and Managements: Dividend Policy…
Should there be dividend payouts? It was typical that only the weaker companies needed to retain earnings for profitability expansion. Now “profitable investment” theory has been gaining ground. The better the growth, the readier investors accept lower payouts. Which might not make much sense.
Stock dividends are equally acceptable
Should the intelligent investor go about becoming an intelligent owner?
Is the management reasonably efficient?
Are the interests of the average outside shareholder receiving proper recognition?
We should judge the efficiency of management by comparing each company’s profitability, size, and competitiveness against similar firms in its industry.
Following Enron disaster:
Never dig so deep into the numbers that you leave common sense at the door
Always read the proxy statement before and after you buy a stock
Proxy statements are sent to every shareholder for its AGM. Most investors don’t bother to read. Should rally on yahoo finance or only message boards to join your case and vote!
Managers: want more capital to manage their business well, and may not allocate capital efficiently
Stockholders: want efficient finance, produce at Low cost and find the most profitable articles to sell.
There is statistical evidence that suggests that when current dividends are Low, future corporate earnings also turn out to be Low, and when current dividends are high, so are future earnings. Most managers are wrong when they say they can put your cash to better use than you can.
Companies get a tax break when executives and employees exercise stock options considered as compensation expense; they favour stock buy backs as dividends as they cause shareprice to be more volatile, and dividends actually dampens volatility. So if dividends increase their stock value might drop.
Chapter 20 - “Margin of Safety” as The Central concept of investment…
Defined: the past ability to earn in excess of interest requirements constitutes the margin of safety that is counted on to protect the investor against loss or discomfiture in the event of some future decline in net income.
For growth stocks – the margin of safety is always dependent on the price paid. If it is too expensive it will not have a margin of safety
Theory of diversification is closely correlated to margin of safety
Investment vs speculation: a true investment must present a true margin of safety. A true margin of safety is one that can be demonstrated by figures, persuasive reasoning, and by reference to a body of actual experience.
Conventional investments = high grade, state and municipal election bonds and dividend paying stocks
Unconventional is for the enterprising investor
Undervalued common stocks of secondary companies, 2/3rds or less of their underlying value
A sufficiently Low price can turn a security of a mediocre quality to an investment opportunity: but needs to exercise caution via diversification
Conclusion
Know what you are doing – know your business
Do not let anyone else run your business unless 1) you can supervise his performance with adequate care and comprehension or 2) you have unusually strong reasons for placing implicit confidence in his integrity and ability
Do not enter upon an operation – that is manufacturing or trading in an item unless a reliable calculation shows that it has a fair chance to yield a reasonable profit. For the enterprising investor it means that his operation for profit is not based on optimism but on arithmetic.
Have the courage of your knowledge and experience, even if it differs from the crowd
Risk exists in another dimension: inside you. Don’t overestimate how well you really understand an investment or your ability to ride out a temporary plunge in prices.
Well-calibrated confidence (do I understand this investment as well as I think I do?)
Correctly anticipated regret (how will I react if my analysis turns out to be wrong?)
How much experience do I have? What is my track record?
What is the track record of others who have tried this in the past?
If I am buying, someone is selling, what is it that I know that others don’t? Vice versa
How much do I need to break even?
Risk is brewed from an equal dose of Two ingredients: probabilities and consequences
In making decisions under conditions of uncertainty, the consequences must dominate the probabilities.
Summary of 20 chapters
By Warren Buffett;
The common intellectual theme of the investors is this: they search for discrepancies between the value of the business and the price of small pieces of that business in the market.
Exploit these discrepancies without the efficient market theorist’s concern. Do not discuss beta, capm, or covarience among securities. Only focus on price vs value.

“Secrets for Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets”
“Technical Analysis”
Ch 1 - Technical Analysis
Questions to accomplish low risk and high profit:
                  1. Where has the stock come from?
                  2. Where does the stock have the potential to go?


TA should work for anything because it is trading on the emotions of people 


You have 3 choices in stocks:
                  1. You believe it will go up so you go long
                  2. You believe it will go down so you are short
                  3. You are uncertain and so you hold cash
Ch 2 - The Four Stages
The economic cycle is:
                  1. Expansion
                  2. Peak
                  3. Decline
                  4. Recovery


Stock’s four stages:
                  1. Accumulation - price contraction 
                  2. Markup - higher highs and higher lows
                  3. Distribution - price contraction
                  4. Decline - lower highs and lower lows


Stock price is representative of the emotional state of traders.


Ch 3 - Stage 1 - Accumulation
Generally moving averages (MAs) are crossing back and forth during this period.


The likelihood of a failed rally increases when the longer-term moving average has a negative slope.


Watch what the institutional investors are doing during this phase, but don’t put too much weight on what they do, because fund managers may be a net seller of a security one month and then a net buyer the next month due to window dressing, an unpopular conviction they have in the security, etc.
Clues we are close to the end of an Accumulation Stage
Watch for higher lows, increased trading volume, more frequent tests of a key level of resistance, and the flattening to rising action of longer-term moving averages. 
                  * Higher highs may not yet be happening due to large amounts of supply that have accumulated.
The price should also start holding above MAs.
  

Once we start seeing higher highs we are transitioning into the markup stage.
Ch 4 - Stage 2 - Markup
When the stocks clear the highs of stage one and establish higher highs, the buyers are firmly in control of the stock. This initial move higher is generally accompanied by larger volume than was seen in phase 1.


The market is a discounting mechanism - it is attempting to price in the future at a discount rate, the past is already accounted for and news is already included in the price - trading the news is a losing proposition.


Some investors are caught off-guard when the price moves higher, so they will get excited and want to jump in. Short sellers will have to cover their positions and will also start to buy. The long investors will already be holding.


Price: The Motivator
As the price moves higher some people will want to get out. Long-term holders that were buying when low will start to slow their purchasing as the price moves higher.


As long as the stock continues to find support at a level higher than the low of the last pullback, then the uptrend will remain intact. 


The early moves in an uptrend have a low failure rate, as a trend once established is more likely to continue than it is to reverse. The very definition of an uptrend - higher highs and higher lows - tells us that the best opportunities for profits in an uptrend come from trading in the direction of the trend.
Sheeps, Wolves, Eagles, and Hawks
Greed and fear will drive people to buy on an uptrend as FOMO (sheep grazing) plays out as well as short squeezes. As momentum plateaus, favorable news stories about the recent uptrend will start to drive prices even higher.


Chasing stocks at higher prices at the expense of discipline can be bailed out by an uptrend, which almost rewards and conditions the trader that it was Okay to not have discipline as they are rewarded with a less-than-stellar result. Failure to recognize and correct this behavior will eventually run out and creates a feeling of complacency and numbness. The professional traders will look for these flaws and find ways to profit (i.e. the wolves).
Enter the Momentum Traders
The amateurs (eagles) buy into soaring momentum and get lifted up along the way thinking they are doing great. While the professionals (hawks) are looking for their next prey.


Volume allows us to monitor the strength of an uptrend. Typically an uptrend can persist when the stock experiences rallies on increasing volume and diminishing volume on the pullbacks. Rallies with decreasing volume should be viewed with suspicion, and if volume expands on pullbacks the strength of the trend should be questioned.


The Broken Stairstep
When the bulls take back control of the market,3 things happen:
                  1. The stage is set for higher prices as the momentum traders resume their purchases
                  2. Sidelined cash is enticed to buy
                  3. The short sellers scramble to cover their losing positions


Normally large institutional investors will move a stock higher with a strong upward momentum and we’d like to participate in this action. 


Sometimes there are surprises like fundamental news which will cause an abrupt pullback. If we see a gap lower by 5% or more, then we should probably consider the trend broken.


Late Stage Uptrend: Too Late?
  



The further a stock travels from a valid level of support the riskier purchases are regardless of how mature the trend. When pullbacks fail to bounce back quickly, it can signal a change in the tone of the auction process, particularly if the sell-off came with increased volume.


When a fundamental catalyst precedes a large and sudden pullback consider exiting the stock immediately as this often signals the end of an uptrend. Moving averages begin to cross and this is a signal that distribution is starting.


Ch 5 - Stage 3 Distribution
When the moving averages start to cross after a bull run it indicates indecision. Large volume with no price movement is a sign of being in distribution.

-the value of a business it the expected net cash flows over the life a business, discounted at an appropriate interest rate
--use cash flow to determine value


-as a company matures it should start paying it's earnings out in dividends
--if earnings not paid out in dividends are successfully reinvested, then these earnings should provide dividends


Buffet uses the companies bonds interest rates, but when the rates are low he uses the average accumulative return of the overall stock market.  He uses a risk free rate.


Reinsurers - insure insures


Float costs - income = payouts, float =  0, negative cost of float is a good thing for the company, because the company has more coming in than they are paying out


Buffet generally wants to buy companies to control asset allocation, I presume ensure that capital investments are maximizing returns while also minimizing risks
When he does buy stocks he looks for:
-consistent earnings history, 
-showing good returns on equity
-run by competent honest people
-with attractive prices


little to no debt


Understanding a company
-products, services, labor relations, raw material expenses, plant and equipment, capital reinvestment requirements, inventories, receivables, and working capital


"Investing is most intelligent when it is done most business like." -Graham


Business Tenants
1) Is the business simple and understandable
2) Does the business have a consistent operating history
3) Does the business have favorable long term prospect
-Do they have a moat?
Management Tenants
4) Is management rationale
- do they make smart investments themselves or do they buy growth, or return money to shareholders?
5) Is mgmt candid with it's share holders
- do they openly discuss failure?
6) Does mgmt resist the institutional imperative 
- falling to the expected mgmt model, and not thinking like a company owner
Financial Tenants
7) What is the return on equity
8) What is the company's owner's earnings
9) What are the profit margins
10) Has the company created $1 of market value for every $1 retained
Value Tenants
11) What is the value of the company
12) Can it be purchased at a significant discount to it's value


3 things that make a franchise
- product is needed or highly desired
- no great competition
- not regulated


Supply tight to supply ample years


Maturity, earnings are growing and not needed for growth
However, retaining earnings at less than the average cost of capital
Companies that generate cash in excess and more than it needs, they have 3 options
1) Invest in below average rates
2) Buy growth (acquisitions)
3) Return money to stock holders


Some of Berkshires Companies
Coco-Cola, AMEX, Justin (Tommy Lama), ACME Bricks, Washington Post, The Pampered Chef (pyramid)


What need to be reported is DATA, answering these questions for the readers:
1) Approx. company worth
2) Likelihood to reach it's future obligations
3) How is the mgmt doing, given the hand they were dealt


Indications of the presence of the Institutional Imperative (rationale wilts):
1) Organization resists any change in it's current direction
2) Just as work expands to fill available time corporate projects or acquisitions will materialize to soak up available funds
3) Any business craving of the leader, however foolish, will quickly be supported by detailed rate of return and strategic studies prepared by his troops
4) The behavior of peer companies whether they are expanding, acquiring, or setting executive compensation or whatever, will be mindlessly imitated


Why would someone let the Institutional Imperative happen?
1) Most managers cannot control their lust for activity, and this is often satisfied via business takeovers
2) Most managers are constantly comparing the sales, earnings, and executive compensation of their business with other companies in and beyond their industry. The comparisons invariably invite corporate hyperactivity
3) Most managers have an exaggerated sense of their own management capabilities.


Poor allocation of skills - CEOs often get to where they are from other skills - but they are not that great at allocating capital.
A CEO stating that they can acquire a company if it returns 15% on the investment, it's likely the counsel/VPs will report that the investment can return 15%.


Mindless Imitation: well they are doing this so I must be okay in doing the same thing.


In evaluating people, you look for 3 qualities:
1) Intelligence
2) Integrity
3) Energy




== Financial Tenants
Value
Look at 4-5 year averages 
Focus on return on equity, not earnings per share
Calculate owner's earning to understand value.
High profit margins
For every dollar retained, has the company generated a dollar of market value




Return on equity 
   These are fallacies:
-EPS, did it increase over the past year
-Is EPX high enough? 
Because Increasing EPS by 10% if it is growing it's equity base by 10%.  This is like putting money in a bank account and letting it sit with compounding interest.


The real test of economic performance is:
Are they achieving a high earning rate on equity capital, without undo leverage, accounting gimmickry, etc... Not whether it has consistent gains in EPS.
To measure a companies annual performance you should look at 'Return on Equity'
  Return on Equity = the ratio of operating earnings to shareholders equity
  Return on Equity = operating earnings / shareholders equity


To calculate Return on Equity: 
- All marketable securities should be valued at cost (not at market value - if the market goes up, the return on equity will go down [a bigger denominator])
- Excludes all capital gains and losses as well as any extraordinary items that may increase or decrease opperating earnings, from the numerator
** looking to isolate the specific annual performance of a business i.e. how likely is the the mgmt to generate a specific return on the operations of a business given it's capital


Owner Earnings
-Account earnings per share should be starting point for determining economic value of a business - not the ending point
-First point - not all earnings are created equal, companies with high assets to profits, tend to report their stats earnings, because inflation inflicts a toll on asset heavy businesses - the earning of these business take on a mirage like quality, thus the accounting earnings are only valuable if they calculate the expected cash flow


-Cash flow can also be deceptive and misleading 
--companies with large initial expenses that later have smaller outlays, such as the following can generally be gauged via cash flow:
---real estate, gas fields, and cable companies
However, companies that require on-going expenditures are not accurately represented using only cash flow


- Cash Flow (generally) = Net income after taxes + depreciation + depletion + amortization + other non-cash charges
-- This definition misses something very important - Capital Expenditures (how much money must the company use for plant upgrades and other improvements?)
-- 95% of US require capital expenditures that = their depreciation rates


People focus on cash flow and this is misleading.  This is why you should focus on Owner Earnings


- Owner Earnings = Net income after taxes + depreciation + depletion + amortization - capital expenditures and working capital needed


- Capital Expenditures = require a rough estimate




Profit Margins
-How are retained earnings used?
-If the value goes higher than the dollar to dollar ratio then that's all the better
-For every dollar it retained it created how much market value - Coco-Cola over 10 years
---$10 -> $45 && $25.8B →$143.9B ==> $100 invested -> $691 (dividends reinvested) @ 21% / yr && $29.6B in profit and paid out $10.5B in dividends and kept $16.4B for reinvestment... for every dollar retained it created $7.20 in market value




John Burough Williams - Dividend Discount Model - The theory of investment value
Value = Net cash flow, owner earnings, expected to occur of the life of the business discounted by an appropriate percentage rate




== VALUE


Determine the total value of the company (using Owner earnings) in the future
Then discount that value back to todays date


To properly value a business
Take all of the cash flows of a business between now an eol, then discount those at an appropriate discount rate, this is why you use businesses that are easy to predict


How confident can you be that those cash flows will occur.


MSFT - how do you evaluate the future and long term earnings potential
What is the appropriate discount rate?  
Using Government Bonds - this is a risk free rate, when bond yields dipped below 7% he used a discount rate of 10% if interest rates go up, then they will match 


John Burr Williams dividend discount model. The theory of investment value. The best way to value a company.


The value of a company = The total of the net cash flow, owners earning, expected over the life of the business discounted by an appropriate interest rate.




“Buffettology”


Investment banks agree to sell the stocks and charge a commission for businesses, and they hold the stocks


Business bonds are just bonds sold to the public as if they were loans from banks


Only invest in
1. A company that you can reasonably predict the future earnings.
2. A company that will reinvest is earnings into making the company more profitable
3. Consumer monopoly, a company had unusually high returns
4. A company that is currently a bargain
5. Pick the business you want to be in and let the price decide if it is a good deal
6. Calculations site a 15% annual compounding rate of better
7. Use as much money as you can when you find what is working


Holds the business forever if the economics of the business stay the same. This ensures that he will benefit from the compounding effect of retained earnings. Compounding interest works tax free, whereas selling and losing taxes is a snapshot


When investing
- should be waiting for the market to go down to get that bargain price
- you don't buy stock because you think it is going up next week
- you should not be looking for a % move in price over the next few months, but because your are looking for a % return everyday every year for the next 10 years


Discounting to present value
- this is a way to use a business's history to calculate the percent return every year and enabled you to predict the future growth


The company's management has a huge impact. Are they reinvesting the profits into the company and profitably employing them? Paying dividends or paying themselves? Should the capital be used to buy or invest in other companies?
 o How do we check?


- The price you pay determines the rate of return you are going to get
- $5 / $20 = 25%
- $5 / $40 = 12.5%
- To predict the rate of return you must be able to reliably predict the companies future earnings


3 variables to consider
1. The yearly per share earnings figure
2. It's predictability
3. The market price of the security

Compounding and tax free is amazing
Compounding is great
Static percentages like bonds which are also taxed are not so great unless the percentage is high enough to compensate

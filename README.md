# Overview

The python scripts provided in this project facilitates trying different buy and sell strategies for stock and crypto
currencies. There are also scripts that provide different types of security analysis. Both technical analysis and
fundamental analysis are considered.

This software is intended for educational purposes only and nothing it produces should be taken as investment advice.
It's accuracy is not guaranteed, the software may have bugs, or the data that it receives from 3rd parties may be
inaccurate. You are responsible for verifying the results that are produced.

# Features

Some of these features are:

* Back-Testing Investment Strategies
* Machine Learning Predictors
* Investment Strategy Comparators
* Intrinsic Value Calculations
* Alerts
* Automated Order Placement

## Single Stock Strategies

Some of the already added strategies are:

* Buy and Hold strategy
* Buy low Sell High
* Trade on MACD Signal
* Trade on RSI
* Black soldiers and white crows

It's easy to add more, so this list will continue to grow.

## Multi stock strategy

Monitor 5 stocks, when any are below RSI 40 buy, when it crosses 70 sell, buy the next of the five to cross 40, rinse and repeat

## Use different values with one stock to find the optimal - then do this across multiples

* First part is done, but now we need to use it to determine the optimal strategy across several symbols

## Build table of RSI and MACD and use it to predict the next relative price movement of a stock

* This is the correlation of RSI and MACD with how other investors act based on this data

## Integrated ML/AI to make price model predictor and then use it to trade

* Separate groups of data are used for training the model and another for testing/prediction

# Testing

## Sequential

The built in unittest runner can be invoked here

    python -m unittest discover ./test/

The built in unittest runner can also be invoked here with custom configuration:

    /app/src/test.py

## Parallel

To test in parallel use:

    pip install unittest-parallel
    cd /app
    unittest-parallel -t ./src/ -s ./src/test/ -v

In PyCharm this can be setup using a configuration with runs script:

* Script path

    /usr/local/bin/unittest-parallel

* Parameters

    -t ./src/ -s ./src/test/ -v

# Coverage

Working flow is to run this as you work and make sure you are maintaining coverage.

    unittest-parallel -t ./src/ -s ./src/test/ --coverage --coverage-rcfile .coveragerc --coverage-html ./coverage

# Example output

# Proposal for new Adapter design

To get the data we need to connect the ValueType
    url
    end-point
    query params (apikey, args, etc.)
    the key to the location of the ValueType
    a conversion algorithm

# Proposal for new Visualizer design

Given the canned data in a time-series format graph as: bar, line
Given the canned data of high, low, open, close graph as: candle-stick
Add ability to
* draw annotations on any
* select if multiple are added to any one plot with a legend
* select if multiple are added to a single window

# Planned

## Play with

6/10 best days for the market came right after the worst 2 weeks
* Check for 2 weeks of down trend across the market or a sector
* Model buying here with an exponential increase

Exponential increase
* at 50% dip invest 99.999% of cash
* at 1% dip invest 2% or something similar
* these are percents of percents, so 2% + 4% the cash pool is getting smaller adn these percents are not the same as the
  percent when the strategy starts, try to see if we can compensate for that

Narrowing Yield Curves
* generally indicative of an on coming recession or a slowing of growth
* sharp decline in bonds
    * the 5 year yields are going up and 30 year yields are going down June 18 2021
    * the 5 year prices are going down and 30 year prices are going up June 18 2021
* Powell thinks we have more disk of seeing disinflation
    * commodities like copper have been going down for ~20 years and in the last 6-8 weeks we just broke out of that and
      trended up for the first in a long time, commodities are just now (June 19th 2021) going down again

Crypto leverage
* it is expected that because of no regulation cryptos are highly leveraged... what does this mean?
    * is crypt trade on margin?
    * is more than a 9/10 lent out?

## Identify highly shorted

* After GME heavily shorted companies will probably do well
* In addition to this, we need to be able to see how many shares were available
* For the short position to be open someone has to buy the stock and hold it so that someone else can short it
  if the number of available shares is low, then it's easier to buy through the resistance levels and push the stock
  higher and higher, the compound that with the short squeeze and wow

## Normal Orders

    Order Types       - market: $50
    market            - buy: $50 (market)   sell: $50 (market)
    stop-loss         - buy: $55 -> market  sell: $45 -> market (a.k.a. stop order)
    limit             - buy: $45 (or less)  sell: $55 (or more)
    stop-limit        - buy(stop: $55 limit: $60): $55 -> $60 (or less)
                        sell(stop: $45 limit: $40): $45 -> $40 (or more)
    trailing stop     - buy(trailing: $5): low + $5 -> market
                      - sell(trailing: $5): high - $5 -> market
    one-cancels-other - limit + stop-limit

For _buy_ imagine stock closes one day $45 and then opens at $65

* stop-loss would execute at $65
* stop-limit would create a limit order at $60, but would not execute

For _sell_ imagine stock closes one day $55 and then opens at $35

* stop-loss would execute at $35
* stop-limit would create a limit order at $40, but would not execute

## Install pycharm into /root persistent local volume

    curl https://download-cf.jetbrains.com/python/pycharm-community-2020.3.3.tar.gz > /tmp/file_to_extract
    tar -xzf /tmp/file_to_extract -C /root/
    rm -rf /tmp/file_to_extract

Run with:

    /root/pycharm-community-2020.3.3/bin/pycharm.sh /app

Then locate the Dockerfile installed pip packages by switching the interpreter to:

    /usr/local/bin/python

## Run without cython for debugging (if not hitting breakpoints otherwise):

    PYDEVD_USE_CYTHON=NO /root/pycharm-community-2020.3.3/bin/pycharm.sh /app

## Install a browser like Chrome with

    cd /root
    curl https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
    apt update
    
    apt install google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
    /usr/bin/google-chrome-stable --no-sandbox
    
    # Didn't work to install to root dir
    #dpkg-deb -x /root/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb /root/google-chrome/

## IDEA IDE logs and fixes

### Hyperlinks in console stop working

Regular hyperlinks like https://google.com only work if you have a browser setup in the container
(many do not).

File hyperlinks only work in Python console. To run and debug from the Python console then edit
the run configuration > [x] (check) Run with Python console


### libnss3

Looking for missing libs:

    ldd /root/pycharm-community-2020.3.3/jbr/lib/libjcef.so | grep "not found"

    apt-get install -y unzip wget libnss3

That seems to have fixed it

### No connection

Debugger magically broke...

This sounds to be related to `__str__` conversions which has just been changed, but was able to find another workaround
which is to go to:

# Concepts

    DataAdapters - Interfaces to data bases/services/etc. A single dataAdapter
                   can be used with multiple symbolAdapters but sometimes there are duplicates - the cache helps here.
    SymbolAdapters - Owns dataAdapters for a symbol and has interval, current time, as well as
                     historic price data for that symbol
    SymbolCollection - A collection of symbolAdapters referenced by symbol
                       and tracks the baseSymbol
    Portfolio - Represents quantities of symbols which tracks it's value over time
                The only representation of 'today' is the getLastCompletedTime which is really now - 1
                as we have not yet calculated the current day - where we are

## User can pick data provider

For one stock a user may want series from provider A and MACD from another provider
Each of these requires a different data adapter, but we should store under the symbol adapter for one symbol

The client API to get value:

    collection.get_value(symbol, instance, value_type)

When the user requests a value it should traverse like:

    SymbolCollection()
    collection[symbol] -> SymbolAdapter()  # value_type -> query_type
                          symbolAdapter[query_type] -> DataAdapter(symbol)  # type should represent query_type
                                                       data_adapter.get_value(instance, value_type)

Construction:

    symbol_types = {'ETH': SymbolType.DIGITAL_CURRENCY}
    base_symbol = 'USD'
    series_data_adapter: SeriesAdapter = AlphaVantageAdapter('AMD', base_symbol)
    series_data_adapter.series_interval = interval
    series_data_adapter.asset_type = AssetType.EQUITY
    symbol_adapter = SymbolAdapter(symbol)
    symbol_adapter.data_adapters[QueryType.SERIES] = series_data_adapter
    rsi_data_adapter: RsiAdapter = BinanceAdapter('AMD', base_symbol)
    rsi_data_adapter.interval = interval
    rsi_data_adapter.period = period
    symbol_adapter.data_adapters[QueryType.RSI] = rsi_data_adapter
    macd_data_adapter: MacdAdapter = BinanceAdapter()
    macd_data_adapter.fast_period = fast
    macd_data_adapter.slow_period = slow
    macd_data_adapter.signal_period = signal
    symbol_adapter.data_adapters[QueryType.MACD] = macd_data_adapter
    collection = SymbolCollection()
    collection.baseSymbol = 'USD'  # propagate to all data adapters on set?
    collection.add_symbol_adapter(symbol_adapter)
